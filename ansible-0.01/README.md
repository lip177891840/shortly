Ansible
=======

Ansible is a radically simple configuration-management, deployment, task-execution, and 
multinode orchestration framework.   

Read all about at it at (http://ansible.github.com)

Design Principles
=================

   * Dead simple setup
   * Super fast & parallel by default
   * No server or client daemons; use existing SSHd
   * No additional software required on client boxes
   * Modules can be written in ANY language
   * Awesome API for creating very powerful distributed scripts
   * Be usable as non-root
   * The easiest config management system to use, ever.

Get Involved
============

   * [ansible-project mailing list](http://groups.google.com/group/ansible-project)
   * irc.freenode.net: #ansible
